Matlab Applicantion: Induction Motor Dinamic Behavior

During my cientific iniciation I had some problems to simulate many times the induction motor dinamic 
behavior to build the data banch. So I made a Matlab application to help this issue and learn to job 
with programs interfaces. Then I rescued this abandoned code and put it public, maybe someone can use 
it to learn, do researchs or even joy.

Every code I used to do this application is diponible in Git repository with descritives comments. 
Besides that I put togheter a manual to help the users. This app simulate the induction motor dinamic 
behavior with three possibles tension inputs: Sinusoidal, Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) 
and Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM).
