Matlab Applicantion: Induction Motor Dinamic Behavior

## Install APP
To install the applicantion you run the Matlab, go to the APP tab, click on "Install APP" and select
the "SimulaMIT.mlappinstall". Even, you can download all the routines files navigate (edit) and execute
them directelly.

## Motivation
During my cientific iniciation I had some problems to simulate many times the induction motor dinamic 
behavior to build the data banch. So I made a Matlab application to help this issue and learn to job 
with programs interfaces. Then I rescued this abandoned code and put it public, maybe someone can use 
it to learn, do researchs or even joy.

## Archives
Every code I used to do this application is diponible in Git repository with descritives comments. 
Besides that I put togheter a manual to help the users. This app simulate the induction motor dinamic 
behavior with three possibles tension inputs: Sinusoidal, Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) 
and Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM).
